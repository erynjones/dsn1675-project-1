<h1>Eryn Jones</h1>

<p>Just a little about me, I study graphic design at Algonquin College and I am currently in my second year. When I’m not at school I like to travel and experience the world. I’ve been to a couple different places over the years. I would have to say I have been to Florida a many, many times but still always want to go back. Some of my favourite places that I have visited are definitely the warmer Caribbean climates like Jamaica and Cuba. But I’ve also traveled a fair bit around Canada as well. I pretty much end up going to Cape Breton, Nova Scotia for a little bit every summer because most of my family is from that area. I’ve only been to a little bit of Europe, France and England, but can’t wait to go experience other places in that region. Other passions of mine are photography, design and art. I really like trying to create new things and seeing what my brain can come up with. In the end I’m just a shy, creative, blonde who is trying to build a life for herself.</p>
